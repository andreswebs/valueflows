# Demand-driven example: $30 wind turbine electrical generator

One interesting feature of this example is an open-source recipe that was published on the Web: http://www.opensourcelowtech.org/wind_turbine.html

In order to implement it, we [copied and pasted the recipe into NRP](http://nrp.webfactional.com/accounting/xbomfg/16/). But that is because NRP was not able to plan from recipes from the Web, and also because doing so will require recipes published in some shared vocabulary (VF maybe?)

If that happens (recipes published in repositories using common vocabularies) then open source hardware can become like open source software: reusable, collaborative, forkable, etc.

Here's the [plan generated from the recipe](http://nrp.webfactional.com/accounting/order-timeline/7/)
