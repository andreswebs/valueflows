**How can we describe managing the commons for community benefit, in terms of VF?**

The classic commons situation, let's say a lake and fish case. 
A collective agent is in the stewardship relation to the lake and controls (not owns) the stream of benefits (fish volume) under an obligation to:
- keep it sustainable (no overfishing)
- distribute benefits properly (community standards)

I know it is possible to describe it in the VF language -- do you have any examples?
But then, the problem occurs if we put this in the chain of processes, connected with different frames of reference:
- fishing equipment provider works within capitalist fame of reference.
- regional authorities do not recognise stewardship and request community to acqiure ownership or else. 

How do we interface various systems within the same chain?
