# Buying Club (Driftless Co-Option)

This use case is specifically to look at how this buying club thinks about flow times, but may have other uses too.

The buying club runs on cycles of (usually) 4 weeks.  Each cycle has a sequential number identifying it.  Accounting takes place by cycle.  Accounting is basically that every member needs to work 3 hours/cycle to order in a cycle.  It doesn't need to be during the same month, and people can go negative, but people try to stay reasonably up to date.

There are different ways of working.
* Regularly scheduled work at specific times in the cycle: like splitting food, gathering orders, cashiering, cleaning up.  People sign up every cycle on pre-planned jobs/shifts.
* Work at home that has due dates, but otherwise doesn't matter when it is done, where the time is managed by the person doing the work: like updating catalogs, printing invoices and labels, ordering from suppliers, paying suppliers.

People who signed up for specific shift work record the specific times worked.

People who work at home record their time as hours per cycle on a spreadsheet.
