### UML Representation

![VF uml picture](https://rawgit.com/valueflows/valueflows/master/release-doc-in-process/ValueFlowsUML.png)

Note: There are some differences in this representation and the RDF based representation.  
* This is to support object oriented and relational implementations, as well as open vocabularies that are not RDF based.  This is mostly where there are rdf properties not associated with classes.
* This includes all elements necessary for the vocabulary, so includes (and denotes) necessary elements that we re-use from other vocabularies.
