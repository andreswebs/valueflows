Resource categories are a Taxonomy. That means they can be defined very broadly and generally and maybe vaguely, or they can be defined very narrowly,
but fit into broader categories. 

So, for example, you may want an apple. Or you may want a green apple. Or you may want a Granny Smith apple.
Or you may want a Granny Smith apple from your neighboring farm.

People can use the multitude of existing taxonomies for resources, or can also create their own as needed.
