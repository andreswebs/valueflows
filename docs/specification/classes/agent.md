(Question: can/should this also have properties for its relationships (where it is an object or subject)?)

A vf:Agent is empowered to control or affect the flow of economic resources (including his or her own labor) by engaging in economic events. vf:Agents are also empowered to make commitments or promises to affect resource flows in the future. Or putting it another way, a vf:Agent can participate in economic events.
