# Agent

The agent vocabulary describes networks of people and groups, using agents and their relationships.

In ValueFlows, we are talking about economic agents, agents who can create or exchange value, make agreements, etc.  But we want to re-use existing vocabularies for commonly defined things, so we have elected to use those as much as possible here.
