# Agent

The agent vocabulary describes networks of people and groups, using agents and their relationships.

In ValueFlows, we are talking about economic agents, agents who can create or exchange value, make agreements, etc.  But we want to re-use existing vocabularies for commonly defined things, so we have elected to use those as much as possible here.

#### Relationships

A relationship can be direct, like "steward" or "like", or more like a role.
Role types of relationships are often used for a person's role in an organization or group,
for example "grower" or "harvester" for a food network.

There are a number of useful Properties in existing vocabularies that can be used.
Or people can create their own as needed.

Although it usually is, the relationship of a particular type does not have to be agreed to from both sides, for example "follow".

Direction: For example, in "Michael is a member of Enspiral", Michael is the subject and Enspiral is the object.
 

Context: This allows grouping of economic relationships and economic activity (future releases) into a context for coordination and accounting purposes.  For agent relationships, it is needed for cases like "Kathy is mentor of Sam, in the context of Enspiral."
