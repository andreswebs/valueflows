# Transfer

A `transfer` is an activity (a flow) that re-assigns primary rights and responsibilities for an economic resource from one agent to another, but does not transform or transport the economic resource. A transfer removes the resource from future accounting for the provider, and adds the resource for future accounting for the receiver.

Note: We think that now, and more so in the future, there will be more gradations of rights and responsibilities for resources than are sometimes considered now.  For example, as a society we may decide that we should take more responsibility for recycling or upcycling resources at the end of their useful life for us, or not wasting them.  The concept of "ownership" may transition more into "stewardship" in a concept of the world that does not put humans in a position of controlling the world's resources or abdicating responsibilities to the ecosystem in the name of ownership.

Note that giving secondary rights, such as the rights to use a resource, are not considered transfers.  Lesser rights (which are varied) can be defined by reference to an agreement in a non-transfer flow, like `possess`.  For example, loaning a library book involves giving some rights and responsibilities in addition to possession, but is not considered a transfer. However, selling or giving away the book is considered a transfer.

We also want to note that transfers do not imply explicit or implicit exchanges, only a one-directional flow.  See the [exchange section](https://valueflo.ws/introduction/exchanges.html) for discussion of multi-directional flows.

### Change of physical possession vs. transfer

A related action is `possess`, meaning to change possession of a resource from one agent to another.  This often (but not always) happens in conjunction with a transfer.  When this does happen, for example in a market point of sale situation, then the two economic events should be handled in series, with the `possess` event triggering the `transfer` event.

Possession sometimes changes as part of other actions of economic events, such as `load` or `unload`, and these and other actions can also trigger a `transfer`.  An example is when an economic resource is shipped, with full rights being transferred at the beginning or end of the shipping process (sometimes called FOB source or FOB destination), according to an agreement.
