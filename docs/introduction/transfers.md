# Transfer

A transfer is an activity that assigns some rights and responsibilities for an economic resource from one agent to another, but does not transform or transport the economic resource.

We think that now, and more so in the future, there will be more gradations of rights and responsibilities for resources than are sometimes considered now.  For example, as a society we may decide that we should take more responsibility for recycling or upcycling resources at the end of their useful life for us, or not wasting them.  The concept of "ownership" may transition more into "stewardship" in a concept of the world that does not put humans in a position of controlling the world's resources or abdicating responsibilities to the ecosystem in the name of ownership.

* For example, perhaps some agent has many apple trees, and plans on pressing apple cider. Another agent has an apple press and agrees to exchange use of the press (a resource) for a portion of the apple cider.  The use of the press involves some rights (to use the press for some period of time) and responsibilities (to not run it beyond its capacity and to clean it up before returning it), and the rights and responsibilities to a portion of apple cider is transferred in exchange.

* Or in a library, a book can be checked out for a period of time.  The agent who checks it out is responsible for caring for it and returning it on time, and can read it, or use it however they want.

* Or let's say that a community has farmland and equipment held in common.  The community transfers that to some farmers to use and take care of.  The community also transfers seeds every year to the farmers, enough to grow the food the community needs.  During the year, the harvests are distributed (transferred) to the community members for their consumption.  In reciprocity, the community provides for other needs of the farmers.

In spite of these examples, we also want to note that transfers do not imply explicit or implicit exchanges, only a one-directional flow.
