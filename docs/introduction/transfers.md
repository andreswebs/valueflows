# Inventory and Transfers

*Inventory* is a term used primarily today to mean resources owned by an agent, like assets that will appear on a balance sheet.  We would like to expand that definition to any record of resources that an agent has some responsibility for.  For example, a shipper may need to know the inventory on the truck; or an agent may want to know about resources that they are using but do not own in a similar way as those they own.

We think that now, and more so in the future, there will be more gradations of rights and responsibilities for resources than are sometimes considered now.  For example, as a society we may decide that we should take more responsibility for recycling or upcycling resources at the end of their useful life for us, or not wasting them.  The concept of "ownership" may transition more into "stewardship" in a concept of the world that does not put humans in a position of controlling the world's resources.

Here are some defined roles that agents can play in relationship to resources, usually for some period of time.
* *ownership* (current definition of full rights and responsibilities)
* *stewardship* (emphasis more on responsibilities, but can be used interchangeably in the vocabulary with *ownership*)
* *xx* (rights to use a resource, usually with attendant responsibilities; does not imply actual use)
* *possession* (does not imply any rights, although there likely are some responsibilities involved)

The notion of *availability* is useful also when it comes to inventory, and can be calculated for any current or future point in time or period of time, based on current quantities and current/future commitments for production, consumption, usage, transportation, transfer of full rights or rights to use to some other agent, etc.

Those defined roles also affect the way we look at transfers.  Transfers can be of full or partial rights and responsibilities for resources, or possession of resources. So transfers affect inventory of various kinds.  We want to emphasize that for all of this, we want to focus on **economic coordination**.



=========== move the following elsewhere ===============

For example, perhaps some agent has many apple trees, and plans on pressing apple cider. Another agent has an apple press and agrees to exchange use of the press (a resource) for a portion of the apple cider.  The use of the press involves some rights (to use the press for some period of time) and responsibilities (to not run it beyond its capacity and to clean it up before returning it), and the rights and responsibilities to a portion of apple cider is transferred in exchange.

Or in a library, a book can be checked out for a period of time.  The agent who checks it out is responsible for caring for it and returning it on time, and can read it, or use it however they want.

Or let's say that a community has farmland and equipment held in common.  The community transfers that to some farmers to use and take care of.  The community also transfers seeds every year to the farmers, enough to grow the food the community needs.  During the year, the harvests are distributed (transferred) to the community members for their consumption.  In reciprocity, the community provides for other needs of the farmers.
